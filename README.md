# End To End Traffic Safety System

## Problem Statement:
1. Develop an end-to-end traffic safety monitoring system
2. Detect vehicles in real-time video feed
3. Identify and record traffic violations
4. Save violation incidents with timestamps
5. Provide real-time visual monitoring capability


The system currently has basic structure but requires implementation of specific detection algorithms for vehicles and violations.
